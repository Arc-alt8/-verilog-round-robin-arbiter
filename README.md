# Round Robin Arbiter – Verilog

A Verilog implementation of a 4-input Round Robin Arbiter that allocates access to shared resources fairly among competing requests.

##  Features
- Round-robin arbitration logic using `last_grant`
- Fully testbenched in SystemVerilog
- Simulated using EDA Playground with waveform validation

##  Files
- `design.sv` – Main arbiter module
- `testbench.sv` – Testbench with various input scenarios

##  Tools Used
- Verilog/SystemVerilog
- Icarus Verilog
- EDA Playground for simulation
